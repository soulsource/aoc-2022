-- Well, part 2 sucks. But we can do a scanl to transform each tree in each of the 4 sides to its viewing distance.
-- Or, probably it's easier to just write the function instead of using scanl.
-- And once that's d√∂ner, we can rotate everything back to the original orientation, multiply up and boom, partay!
